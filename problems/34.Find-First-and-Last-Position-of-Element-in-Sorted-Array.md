## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/

## Problem Description
```
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
nums is a non-decreasing array.
-109 <= target <= 109
```

## Approach and Solution
I solved this question using Binary Search. Binary search is a method of searching in which a search space gets divided by considering middle element.
Often use it in questions where arrays are already sorted. Binary search has a constant space complexity and a time complexity of log(N).

Now in this question we have an array and a target is given to us. We need to find from which index to which index is the target repititevely present.
And return the two set of indices as an array. 
I solved it by running Binary search twice one for each occurance. In the first occurance i change the end pointer's position to check with the extreme left possibility.
And change the start pointer's position to check with the extreme right possibility. And then returning both indices as an array.



```java
class Solution {
    public int[] searchRange(int[] arr, int target) {
        int up = upper(arr, target);
        int low = lower(arr, target);
        return new int[] {up, low};
    }
    //running binary search twice one to check for first occurence and second for second occurance
    static int upper(int[] arr, int target){
        int start =0;
        int end = arr.length-1;
        while(start<=end){
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
            if(target<arr[mid]){
                end = mid - 1;
            }else if (target>arr[mid]){
                start = mid + 1;
            }else{
                if(mid == 0 || arr[mid-1 ] != arr[mid]){//we are shifting the end pointer to check for extreme left possibility
                    return mid;
                }
                else{
                    end = mid - 1;
                }
            }      
        }
        return -1;
    }
    static int lower(int[] arr, int target){
        int start =0;
        int end = arr.length-1;
        while(start<=end){
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
            if(target<arr[mid]){
                end = mid - 1;
            }else if (target>arr[mid]){
                start = mid + 1;
            }else{
                if (mid == arr.length - 1 || arr[mid+1] != arr[mid]){//we are shifting the end pointer to check for extreme right possibility
                    return mid;
                }
                else{
                    start = mid +1;
                }
            }      
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
}
