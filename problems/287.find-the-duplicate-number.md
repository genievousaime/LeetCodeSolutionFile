https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/

## Problem Description
```
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
 

Follow up:

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

## Approach and Solution
I solved this using Cycle sort. In this method of sorting we approach to swap and put the elements in their right index when the numbers are given in the range of [1,N]. Its time complexity is O(N) and space complexity is constant (O(1)).

If you notice in this question, all the numbers once sorted are equal to (index +1 ) since the array begins from 1 till N.

We use cyclic sort to first sort the array using the CHECK, SWAP and MOVE approach. Since we are looking for duplicates let us consider to cases that can arise:

Case 1: The element in the wrong index is a unique one and hence we swap it with its right index. In this question index = value - 1.

Case 2: The element in the wrong index is a duplicate one and hence we return it as the answer. Since its original exists and is at the right index, therefore our wrong index element is the right answer.




```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] arr) {
        int i = 0;
        while(i < arr.length){
            int correct = arr[i] - 1;
            if(arr[i] != i + 1){//checking that the element is at the wrong index or not. if yes swap if original.
                if(arr[i] != arr[correct]){
                    swap(arr, i, correct);
                }else{//else if duplicate return as answer
                    return arr[i];
                }   
            }else{
                  i++;// continue sorting if above conditions dont meet
                }    
        }
        return -1;//no duplicates found return -1 as ans
    }
    void swap(int arr[], int first, int second){//simple swapping code
    int temp = arr[first];
    arr[first] = arr[second];
    arr[second] = temp;
    }
}
