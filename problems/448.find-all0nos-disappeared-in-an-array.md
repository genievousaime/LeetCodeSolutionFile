## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/

## Problem Description
```
Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= n
 

Follow up: Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.


```

## Approach and Solution
I solved this using Cycle sort. In this method of sorting we approach to swap and put the elements in their right index when the numbers are given in the range of [1,N]. Its time complexity is O(N) and space complexity is constant (O(1)).

If you notice in this question, all the numbers once sorted are equal to (index +1 ) since the array begins from 1 till N.

We start the search from the beginning of the array(intially unsorted) until we reach that first index which is not equal to the value, here in this question we are looking for INDEX=VALUE - 1 and when we come across a number whose index is not equal to value-1, we return index+1 as the answer required


```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDisappearedNumbers(int[] arr) {
	//cycle sort
        int i = 0;
        while( i < arr.length){
            int correct = arr[i] -1;
            if(arr[i] != arr[correct]){
                swap(arr, i, correct);
            }else{
                i++;
            }
        }
        //just find missing numbers
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int index = 0;index < arr.length; index++){
            //simple linear search
            if( arr[index]!= index + 1){
                ans.add(index+1);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
   
    void swap(int arr[], int first, int second){
    int temp = arr[first];
    arr[first] = arr[second];
    arr[second] = temp;
    }
    


}
