## Problem Description
```
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums. 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.
 

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

## Approach and Solution
I solved this using Cycle sort. In this method of sorting we approach to swap and put the elements in their right index when the numbers are givien in the range of [0,N]. Its time complexity is O(N) and space complexity is constant (O(1)).

If you notice in this question, all the numbers once sorted are equal to their index value since the array begins from 0 till N. Hence we arrive at two cases.

Let me sumarize you through two cases we can encounter in this question-

Case 1: We start the search from the beginning of the array(intially unsorted) until we reach that first index which is not equal to the value, here in this question we are looking for INDEX=VALUE and when we come across a number whose index is not equal to value, we return that index because that index is the answer required.

Case 2: Suppose we dont have N in the array i.e N is the answer. We will simple run cycle sort and then linear search till we find which number is missing and return it/ find which index's number is missing and return that index.

One thing to notice as well is that in either two cases we discussed above, N is always going to be absent therefore we ignore running through it by running the loop till N without including it.

Below is the source code. Read the comments to understand which step does what.
```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] arr) {
        int i = 0;
        while( i < arr.length){
            int correct = arr[i];
            if(arr[i] < arr.length && arr[i] != arr[arr[i]]){ //arr.length is N which we are ignoring because it is going to be absent in either of the cases we discussed.
//arr[arr[i]] : value jitne index ki value kya hai 
                swap(arr, i, correct);
            }else{
                i++;
            }
        }
        //search for first missing number using linear search
        for (int index = 0;index < arr.length; index++){
            if( arr[index]!= index){
                return index;
            }
        }
        return arr.length;
    }
    
    void swap(int arr[], int first, int second){//simple swap algorithm
    int temp = arr[first];
    arr[first] = arr[second];
    arr[second] = temp;
    }
}
```
