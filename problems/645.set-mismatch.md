## Problem Description
```
You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4


```

## Approach and Solution
I solved this using Cycle sort. In this method of sorting we approach to swap and put the elements in their right index when the numbers are given in the range of [1,N]. Its time complexity is O(N) and space complexity is constant (O(1)).

If you notice this question is a combination of two already existing leetcode questions **_442.Find All Duplicates in an Array_** and **_448.Find All numbers disappeared in an array_**. 
Therefore the entire method and code remains same with slight changes in the way we return answers. 

Two points we note here is that when one element is missing it is equal to index + 1 and the element repeating exists on the same index where the element is missing. Therefore we can conclude:

missing element = index + 1

repetative element = arr[index]



```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] arr) {
      int i = 0;
      while (i < arr.length){
        int correct = arr[i] - 1;
          if(arr[i] != arr[correct]){
            swap(arr, i, correct);
          }else{
            i++;
          }
      }
      //search for the firtst missing number
      for (int index = 0;index < arr.length; index++){
        //simple linear search
        if( arr[index]!= index + 1){
          return new int[] { arr[index], index+1};
        }
      }
        return new int[]{-1,-1};
    }
   
    void swap(int arr[], int first, int second){
    int temp = arr[first];
    arr[first] = arr[second];
    arr[second] = temp;
    }
        
    }


}
```
