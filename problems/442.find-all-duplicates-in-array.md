## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/

## Problem Description
```
Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [2,3]

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= n
Each element in nums appears once or twice.

```

## Approach and Solution
I solved this using Cycle sort. In this method of sorting we approach to swap and put the elements in their right index when the numbers are given in the range of [1,N]. Its time complexity is O(N) and space complexity is constant (O(1)).

This is similar to **_287. Find the Duplicate Number question_**. Here we just need to return the answer in the form of list.
And we also have multiple duplicates. Therefore we run a for loop after sorting is done. Traverse to find the incorrect index with duplicate value.
once found we append it in the list and return it as answer.


```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDuplicates(int[] arr) {
      int i = 0;
      while( i < arr.length){//simple cycle sort first
        int correct = arr[i] -1;
        if(arr[i] != arr[correct]){
          swap(arr, i, correct);
        }else{
          i++;
        }
      }
      List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();//whenever question has find "all duplicates" etc, use a for loop to traverse after sorting. put relevant conditions and then you will have your answer
      for (int index = 0;index < arr.length; index++){
          if( arr[index]!= index + 1){//if element at incorrect index is not equal to the right value it should have
                ans.add(arr[index]);//append the element in wrong index as the ans
            }
    }
      return ans;//return the list containing duplicates
    }
    void swap(int arr[], int first, int second){
    int temp = arr[first];
    arr[first] = arr[second];
    arr[second] = temp;
    }
}
