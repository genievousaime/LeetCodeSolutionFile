## Problem Description
```
Given an unsorted integer array nums, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
```

## Approach and Solution
I solved this using Cycle sort. In this method of sorting we approach to swap and put the elements in their right index when the numbers are given in the range of [1,N]. Its time complexity is O(N) and space complexity is constant (O(1)).

This question is similar to **_268.Missing numbers_**. The only difference is that we add a condition to run loop and check for only positive integers. Therefore using same codebase i added arr[i] > 0 condition and returned index + 1 as the missing value.
 Considered a case 2 of if all elements are present in order then the next positive smallest integer will be N i.e arr.length + 1.




```java
class Solution {
    public int firstMissingPositive(int[] arr) {
      int i = 0;
      while( i < arr.length){
          int correct = arr[i] - 1;
          if(arr[i] > 0 && arr[i] <= arr.length && arr[i] != arr[correct]){
       
                swap(arr, i, correct);
            }else{
                i++;
            }
        }
        //search for smallest positive missing number
        
        for (int index = 0;index < arr.length; index++){
          if( arr[index]!= index + 1){
              return index + 1;
        
            
            }
        }
      //case 2 when all elements present then it returns N as the smallest positive missing number
        return arr.length+1;
    }
    
    void swap(int arr[], int first, int second){
    int temp = arr[first];
    arr[first] = arr[second];
    arr[second] = temp;
    }
}
```
